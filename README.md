Description / Overview
Langton's ant is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. Langton's ant
was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white cells. The "ant" can travel in any of the four cardinal
directions at each step it takes and the "ant" moves according to the following rules:
1.) At a white square, turn 90deg clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
2.) At a black square, turn 90deg counter-clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit

Modes of Behavior
Three distinct modes of behavior are apparent when starting on a completely white grid:
1.) Simplicity. During the first few hundred moves it creates very simple patterns which are often symmetric
2.) Chaos. After a few hundred moves, a large, irregular pattern of black and white squares appears. The ant traces a pseudo-random path until
    around 10,000 steps
3.) Emergent order. Finally the ant starts building a recurrent "highway" pattern of 104 steps that repeats indefinitely.
